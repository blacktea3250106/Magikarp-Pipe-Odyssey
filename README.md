![Gameplay](video/鯉魚王的水管歷險.mp4)

## Overview

Welcome to "Magikarp's Pipe Odyssey," a Java-based game inspired by the popular Flappy Bird! This game was developed during my first year of learning Java programming using Eclipse.

### Introduction

"Flappy Bird" once took the gaming world by storm, and I was just as addicted to this simple yet fun game. However, the repetitive pipe levels made it lose its appeal after setting high scores. That's why I decided to give it a fresh twist by transforming the Flappy Bird character into none other than Magikarp, a beloved Pokémon. When you reach a certain number of pipes, you'll unlock an exciting Easter egg feature.

Can Magikarp defeat the proud Gyarados? Let's find out and witness the transformation of this leaping Magikarp!

## How to Play

- Use the spacebar or click to make Magikarp flap and navigate through the pipes.
- Your goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible and trigger the special surprise.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the game in your Java development environment (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Enjoy the adventure of Magikarp's Pipe Odyssey!
